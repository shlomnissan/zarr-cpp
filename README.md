# ðŸ”¨ Zarr-cpp - A modern C++ reader for Zarr arrays

Zarr-cpp is a modern C++23 library for efficiently reading Zarr arrays â€” a flexible, chunked, compressed storage format designed for large multi-dimensional scientific data. This library provides a simple, high-performance API for opening Zarr arrays, accessing metadata, and reading full arrays, individual chunks, or arbitrary slices of data.

 Designed for clarity, performance, and modern C++ practices, zarr-cpp makes it easy to work with Zarr datasets in high-performance and distributed computing environments.
